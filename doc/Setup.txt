Hello, This is probabably an overkill for a small application but what the hell.
NOTES: Do not tamper with the Makefile, you wouldn't want to swap the tabs with spaces!!!!

directory structure:
if you have just cloned it, mkdir the bin/ and build/ directories.
"bin/": holds the binary executable generated by the project
"build/": holds the object files which need to be linked to make the executable
"doc/" : you are in it, right now!!
"include/": will hold all our custom headerfiles
"lib/": will hold any third party library which we might need(HIGHLY UNLIKELY)
"src/": will have the source files (*.cpp)

run the executable as: ./bin/executable
